In July 2023, Gonzalo Franetovic presented at [ESRA](https://www.europeansurveyresearch.org/conf2023/prog.php) a second version of the 
[Overcoming project](https://artbert96.github.io/arturobertero.github.io//talks/2022-12-12-conference-1). We show that inequality beliefs present more than 
two dimensions in the vast majority of the ISSP countries.
