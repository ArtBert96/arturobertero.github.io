As a political scientist, ECPR is very important to me! In Toulouse, I presented a refined version of the work "Modelling, estimating, simulating", 
which [me and Gonzalo originally presented at SISEC](https://artbert96.github.io/arturobertero.github.io//talks/2023-02-06-conference-3). We were in the
fantastic panel [**"Network of Political Beliefs"**](https://ecpr.eu/Events/Event/PanelDetails/12515), chaired by Lorien Jasny and Claudia Zucca. It was an 
incredible pleasure to receive expert feedback and get in contact with extraordinary researchers from all over the world. Slides are available 
[here](https://artbert96.github.io/arturobertero.github.io/files/ECPR.pdf)!
