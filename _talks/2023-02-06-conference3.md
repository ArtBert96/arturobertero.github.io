At the beginning of 2023, we presented at the conference of the Italian Society of Economic Sociology [**(SISEC)**]([https://issp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ISSP-1st-User-conference-extended-programme_021222-1.pdf](https://www.sisec.it/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/programma-sisec-BS-5-12.pdf)). 
We *modeled* attitudes toward inequality as a complex system. We further *estimated* structural differences in these attitudes across different social groups; 
Finally, we *simulated* attitudinal change to show how they are likely to develop over time. 
[Here](https://arturobertero.github.io/files/SISEC.pdf) are the slides!
