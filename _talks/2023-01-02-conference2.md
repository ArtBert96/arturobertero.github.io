In January 2023 Gonzalo Franetovic and I were pleased to present at [**CHISOCNET**](https://chisocnetdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2023/01/chisocnet-programa.pdf). We adopted network analysis on attitudes toward inequality to investigate how people understand this complex socio-political phenomenon in Chile. Results show that these attitudes are part of a single belief system and that people from lower social status positions have a more multidimensional understanding of inequality. You can find the slides [here](https://artbert96.github.io/arturobertero.github.io/files/CHISOCNET.pdf)
