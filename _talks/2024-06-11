In July 2024, I have finally presented the final version of my PhD project to professors and research groups of various universities. 
First, I presented at the [SPSTrend](https://www.spstrend.it/) research group, in my home university. Second, I presented at Bicocca university, where I was invited by Giulio Costantini (thanks!). 
Finally, I held a seminair for Cristiano Vezzoni's class on Social and Political Attitudes (MA DAPS & CO, UniMi). 

It is now time to present at INSNA Sunbelt, where I will try to squeeze all my research output into a 15 mins presentation. 

You can find the full-version of the slides [here](https://arturobertero.github.io/files/PROJ.pdf)!
