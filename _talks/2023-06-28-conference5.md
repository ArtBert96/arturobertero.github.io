In June 2023 I presented at the [CCA Days](https://www.carloalberto.org/event/nasp-cca-days-2023/), a workshop jointly organized by 
[NASP](https://www.nasp.eu/) and [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/). I had the pleasure of presenting research on Italian vaccine 
hesitancy. The literature on the topic usually conceives hesitancy as a dependent variable of regression models of limited sizes, adopting a reductionist 
approach. To mitigate this limitation, I try to study hesitancy as an emergent phenomenon whose state depends on the intricate relationships occurring 
between its predictors. In the results, I show that this behavior is strongly influenced by a restricted list of variables that I label
*empirical predictors*. This can help design effective intervention strategies.
