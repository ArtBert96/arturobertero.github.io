In December 2022 Gonzalo Franetovic and I were pleased to present at the **1st ISSP User Conference on Social Inequality**. We showed how [*Exploratory Graph Analysis*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174035) can be leveraged to isolate three dimensions of inequality beliefs in all the ISSP countries. This represents an important finding, since most of the literature was anchored to the structuralist/individualist dichotomy. The pdf of the presentation can be found [here](https://artbert96.github.io/arturobertero.github.io/files/ISSP.pdf).
