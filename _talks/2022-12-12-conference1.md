In December 2022 Gonzalo Franetovic and I were pleased to present at the [**1st ISSP User Conference on Social Inequality**](https://issp.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ISSP-1st-User-conference-extended-programme_021222-1.pdf). We showed how [*Exploratory Graph Analysis*](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0174035) can be leveraged to isolate at least three dimensions of inequality beliefs in the vast majority of the ISSP countries. This represents an important finding since most of the literature was anchored to the structuralist/individualist dichotomy. The pdf of the presentation can be found [here](https://artbert96.github.io/arturobertero.github.io/files/ISSP.pdf).
