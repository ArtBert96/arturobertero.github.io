I am a Ph.D. student at [NASP, University of Milan](https://www.nasp.eu/people/students/students-cohorts/arturo-bertero.html). In my BA and MA, I primarily studied Political Communication. Now I am interested in sociopolitical attitudes and political belief systems. Here you find my **CV**, **publications**, and **blog posts**. You can contact me through the channels highlighted on the left.

My Ph.D. thesis revolves around studying sociopolitical attitudes with a network approach. I started by analyzing attitudes toward inequality, and I am now moving forward to understand broader political belief systems. My approach melts two streams of research. First, I rely upon [**Belief Network Analysis**](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691274), a well-established branch of [sociology](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-sociology-archives-europeennes-de-sociologie/article/searching-for-homo-economicus/A1F33AFB1DADF31BF940D2D7C266ACB4) and [political science](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08913810608443650). Second, I exploit the recent methodological advancements of [**Network Psychometrics**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00055-w) to improve social sciences' understanding of these phenomena. My research is highly interdisciplinary and lies at the border between social sciences and psychology, which is my latest interest.
