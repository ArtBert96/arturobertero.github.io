I am a Ph.D. student at [NASP, University of Milan](https://www.nasp.eu/people/students/students-cohorts/arturo-bertero.html). In my BA and MA, I primarily studied Political Communication. Now I am interested in sociopolitical attitudes and political belief systems. Here you find my **CV**, **publications**, and **blog posts**. You can contact me through the channels highlighted on the left (desktop website), or at: arturo.bertero@unimi.it.

My Ph.D. thesis revolves around studying sociopolitical attitudes with a network approach. I started by analyzing attitudes toward inequality, and I am now moving forward to understand broader political belief systems. My approach melts threee streams of research. First, I rely upon [**Belief Network Analysis**](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691274), a well-established branch of [sociology](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-sociology-archives-europeennes-de-sociologie/article/searching-for-homo-economicus/A1F33AFB1DADF31BF940D2D7C266ACB4) and [political science](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08913810608443650).Second, I am interested in the relational heterogeneity highlighted by [Cultural Sociology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304422X17301535). Third, I exploit the recent methodological advancements of [**Network Psychometrics**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-021-00055-w) to improve social sciences' understanding of these phenomena. My research is highly interdisciplinary and lies at the border between social sciences and psychology, which is my latest interest. 

That's an overview of my project:
